# Health Care Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
The Health Care Analytics Dashboard focuses on patient data from CK Clinic, analyzing key health metrics such as heart attacks, diabetes, and exercise habits. The dashboard is designed to provide insights driven by real-time requirements, empowering stakeholders with actionable health data.

## Steps for Dashboard Creation
The dashboard creation process is divided into four key steps:
1. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the patient data in Excel.
2. **Data Import**: Importing the cleaned data into Power BI.
3. **Insight Development**: Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful insights.
4. **Dashboard Formatting**: Enhancing visuals to improve user experience.

## Data Walkthrough
The project includes a comprehensive walkthrough of the patient data structure, detailing fields such as gender, weight, height, health risks, and exercise habits. This ensures the dataset meets the specified analytical requirements.

## Data Import and Cleaning
Instructions for loading and cleaning the data in Power BI are provided, emphasizing the importance of transforming data and identifying any errors or inconsistencies prior to analysis.

## Creating Visual Insights
The dashboard features a variety of visual tools, including pie charts, bar charts, and filters, to display relevant health statistics, such as the number of patients with specific conditions.

## Utilizing DAX for Calculations
DAX functions are employed to compute percentages, averages, and counts based on the health data, delivering actionable insights for further analysis.

## Filter Functionality
Interactive filters for gender and age group are implemented, allowing users to refine and customize the insights displayed on the dashboard.

## Final Formatting of Dashboard
The final video showcases techniques to enhance the dashboard's visual appeal through formatting changes, including color selection, layout adjustments, and the incorporation of an organizational logo.

## Completion and Call to Action
The project concludes with a call to action, encouraging viewers to subscribe, like, and engage with the content if they find value in learning dashboard creation and data analysis skills.

## Conclusion
The Health Care Analytics Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for analyzing patient data and uncovering valuable insights into health trends and risks at CK Clinic. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, we can transform raw data into meaningful visualizations that facilitate informed decision-making and enhance patient care. The interactive features and DAX calculations empower users to explore the data dynamically, making it easier to identify key health metrics and take proactive measures.

Through this project, I aim to inspire others to harness the potential of data analytics in healthcare, ultimately driving improvements in health outcomes and operational efficiency. I encourage you to explore the dashboard, experiment with the data, and utilize the resources provided to enhance your own data analytics skills in Power BI.
